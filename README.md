# CTAI Project

(CTAI) is a Year 2 module in TP. It introduces the concepts of developing and deploying machine learning applications to a cloud platform. It also covers the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and relevant tools provided by the cloud platform.


## What does my CTAI Project do?
- My CTAI project is about creating a cloud-native e-commerce prototype (Urban Vogue) that uses AWS services to improve online clothing shopping.
  
- It integrates AWS Rekognition to detect humans in images, AWS SNS for automated email notifications, and AWS WAF for web security, all deployed on Amazon S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.

- The purpose is to enhance customer experience, reduce return rates, and build a secure, scalable shopping solution leveraging cloud AI.
